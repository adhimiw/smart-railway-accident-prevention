## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style
```cpp
// Good: Clear, descriptive names
int dangerDistance = 30;
bool isBarrierClosed = false;

// Good: Proper commenting
// Calculate distance using ultrasonic sensor
int distance = getDistance();

// Good: Consistent formatting
if (distance <= DANGER_DISTANCE) {
  activateSafetyProtocol();
} else {
  deactivateSafetyProtocol();
}
```

### Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
- Update technical specifications if needed
- Include wiring diagrams for new components
