## 🚂 Introduction

Smart railway stations are advanced and technologically equipped stations that aim to enhance the passenger experience, improve operational efficiency, and ensure safety and security. These stations incorporate various smart technologies such as IoT sensors, artificial intelligence, big data, and cloud computing to offer various services such as smart ticketing, automated fare collection, real-time train tracking, crowd management, and passenger information systems.

This project focuses specifically on **accident prevention** using cost-effective Arduino-based solutions to create a safer railway environment.

## 📝 Abstract

This project proposes the use of **Arduino Uno**, along with **ultrasonic sensors** and **servo motor SG90**, to create a smart railway station accident prevention system. The system is designed to detect and prevent accidents such as platform falls and unauthorized access to restricted areas.

### Key Components:
- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: For distance detection and obstacle sensing
- **Servo Motor SG90**: For automated barrier control
- **Arduino Uno**: Main processing unit
- **Strategic Sensor Placement**: Positioned around critical areas of the railway station

The data collected by these sensors is processed by the Arduino Uno, which then triggers appropriate actions through actuators such as automated barriers. The system also provides monitoring capabilities for railway staff to track sensor status and take appropriate action when necessary.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Real-time Detection**: Continuous monitoring using ultrasonic sensors
- 🚧 **Automated Barriers**: Servo-controlled safety barriers
- ⚡ **Quick Response**: Immediate action upon detecting potential hazards
- 💰 **Cost-Effective**: Affordable solution using readily available components
- 🔧 **Easy Maintenance**: Simple Arduino-based system
- 📊 **Monitoring Interface**: Status tracking for railway staff
- 🛡️ **Safety First**: Prevents platform falls and unauthorized access
