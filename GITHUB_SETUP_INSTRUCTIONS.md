# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🚂 Smart Railway Station Accident Prevention System

### Repository Creation (GitHub Web Interface)

**The GitHub repository creation page is now open in your browser!**

Fill in the following details:

#### Repository Details
- **Repository name**: `smart-railway-accident-prevention`
- **Description**: `Arduino-based Smart Railway Station Accident Prevention System using ultrasonic sensors and servo motors for automated safety barriers. Cost-effective IoT solution for railway safety.`
- **Visibility**: ✅ Public
- **Initialize repository**: 
  - ❌ DO NOT check "Add a README file"
  - ❌ DO NOT check "Add .gitignore"
  - ❌ DO NOT check "Choose a license"
  
  (We already have all these files!)

#### Repository Topics (Add after creation)
```
arduino
iot
railway-safety
ultrasonic-sensor
servo-motor
accident-prevention
smart-station
safety-system
embedded-systems
automation
```

### After Creating the Repository

1. **Copy the repository URL** (should be):
   ```
   https://github.com/adhimiw/smart-railway-accident-prevention.git
   ```

2. **Push your local repository**:
   ```bash
   # Change to main branch (modern standard)
   git branch -M main
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Verify the upload**:
   - Check that all files are visible on GitHub
   - Verify the README.md displays correctly
   - Ensure the demo video is uploaded
